# 🚀 Hey, I'm Akshat Bandooni!  

### 👨‍💻 Code Whisperer | Bug Exterminator 

💡 **Turning caffeine into clean code and ideas into reality.**  

🔹 **JavaScript Enthusiast**—because who needs sleep when you have async/await?  
🔹 **React Explorer**—hooks, state, and components are my playground.  
🔹 **MERN Fanatic**—MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js… basically my comfort zone.  
🔹 **Bug Hunter**—if it’s broken, I’ll fix it (or pretend it’s a feature).

### 🛠️ My Tech Arsenal  
- **Frontend:** Angular , React.js (when Angular lets me down)  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (because PHP and I have trust issues)  
- **Database:** MongoDB, Firebase (SQL? Maybe later)  
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub (because commit history matters!)  
- **Other:** REST APIs, WebSockets, and the occasional Stack Overflow magic
